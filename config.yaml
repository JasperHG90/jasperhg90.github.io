            Hi! I'm Jasper. I've been working as a data specialist for the last five years.
            Currently, I'm a data engineer at GoDataDriven, where I'm applying (and developing) 
            my skills in building data pipelines, analytics engineering, and MLOps. I enjoy 
            equal parts working on R&D projects, productionizing solutions and coaching teams 
            on becoming data-driven.
